# kubespy: tools for observing Kubernetes resources in real time

What happens when you boot up a `Pod`? What happens to a `Service` before it is allocated a public
IP address? How often is a `Deployment`'s status changing?

**`kubespy` is a small tool that makes it easy to observe how Kubernetes resources change in real
time.** Run `kubespy` at any point in time, and it will watch and report information about a
Kubernetes resource continuously until you kill it.

For example, `kubespy status v1 Pod nginx` will continuously emit changes made to a `Pod`'s status
as syntax-highlighted JSON diffs:

## Installation

`kubespy` depends on:

-   [Go](https://golang.org/)
-   [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep)

Once installed, run the following:

```sh
go get github.com/pulumi/kubespy
cd "$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/pulumi/kubespy"
dep ensure

# If $GOBIN is not on your path, you'll need to install the library elsewhere.
go install github.com/pulumi/kubespy/cmd/kubespy
```

From here you can simply run `kubespy`.

## Usage

`kubespy` has two commands:

-   `status <apiVersion> <kind> [<namespace>/]<name>`, which in real time emits all changes made to
    the `.status` field of an arbitrary Kubernetes resource, as a JSON diff.
-   `changes <apiVersion> <kind> [<namespace>/]<name>`, which in real time emits all changes to any
    field in a Kubernetes resource, as a JSON diff.

Several more commands are planned as well.

## Examples

For a concrete example you can run using either Pulumi or `kubectl`, check out [examples/trivial-pulumi-example](https://github.com/pulumi/kubespy/tree/master/examples/trivial-pulumi-example).

## Features

-   [x] Supports any resources the API server knows about, including CRDs (_i.e._, uses the discovery
        client to discover the available API resources, and allows users to query any of them).
-   [x] Displays changes to API objects in real time.
-   [ ] Supports case-insensitive aliases (_e.g._ `kubespy status v1 pod <name>` instead of
        `kubespy status v1 Pod <name>`).
-   [ ] Supports status updates from regex and/or fuzzy matching (_i.e._, make it easy to watch the
        status of `Pod`s generated by `Deployment`s and `ReplicaSet`s).
